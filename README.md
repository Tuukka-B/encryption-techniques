# Encryption Techniques (JAMK 2020 fall period)

This repository contains work I have done in the course 'Encryption Techniques and Systems' held by JAMK University of Applied Sciences in the fall semester of 2020. The course was about various cryptographic tools and standards as well as network security solutions such as VPN. This course had a lot of programming in it as well as Linux configuration (such as setting up IPSec and OVPN tunnels). 

I will share the code I did in this course here. 

## What About Course Assignment Code?

Indeed, we had a course assignment on this course, and we chose to do a programming project. However, for you to be able to view that, you should contact me so we can arrange it. I decide to keep it unpublished in case I want to do something with it in the future. I hope you can understand that.
